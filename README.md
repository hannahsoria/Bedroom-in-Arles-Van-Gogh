# Bedroom-in-Arles-Van-Gogh

"Bedroom in Arles" by Vincent Van Gogh! Move around the room using the mouse and zooming in or out.

intent: I wanted to recreate a known scene in 3D so I chose the painting "Bedroom in Arles" by Vincent Van Gogh. To create this scene I made a room with 3D elements that the user can move around to view. This was an exercise is design spacing, layout, and expanding 3D knowledge.
